### About

This Tetris game is fully inspired by the classic Tetris game developped by Alekse√Ø Pajitnov and released in 1984. Like the original, the player controls the tetrominos with the 4 arrows on the keyboard and try to create complete lines to increase the count of the points. The game stops when the new blocks have no more space to go down.
